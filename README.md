# WikiTrail
Follows the trail of a Wikipedia article to Philosophy. Inspired by the alt-text of http://xkcd.com/903.  
The idea behind a WikiTrail is as follows: if you click the first link in the body of a Wikipedia article not in italics or parentheses, then repeat, you will eventually reach the article for Philosophy.
